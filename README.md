ASP.Net MVC Template Wrappers for JQuery UI

This GitHub Repository holds ASP.NET MVC Wrappers for some widgets in the JQuery UI widget set.

The wrappers are very similar to the stock Html wrappers and implement a Fluent design like Kendo MVC and FluentHtml.

Included is a sample ASP.Net MVC web application for Airport exploring based on NASA WorldWind and Virtual Radar Server / StandingData.

You may also find the "OrderBy" library very interesting.  Instead of hard-coding order by strings, you can mark properties in a
model with an attribute and "OrderBy" does the rest with DbQuery.OrderBy(field, direction).
